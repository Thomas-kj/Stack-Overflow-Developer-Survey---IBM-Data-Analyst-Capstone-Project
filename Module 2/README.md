# Building a dashboard with Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE)

### In this module 2, i have created some visualizations and added them to dashboards using Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE).

## Steps I have done to visualize this dashboard:
* => Download this 2 files [m5_survey_data_demographics.csv] and [m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv]. 
* => Upload these 2 CSV files as data assets to our project in CDE.
* => Create 3 dashboards (3 separate tabs under a single dashboard) as follows:
    #### One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Current Technology Usage.
    #### One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Future Technology Trend.
    #### One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Demographics.

### On the Current Technology Usage dashboard tab, I have used the data asset m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv and captured the following metrics as visualizations.
*	Top 10 LanguageWorkedWith.
*	Top 10 DatabaseWorkedWith.
*	PlatformWorkedWith.
*	Top 10 WebFrameWorkedWith.

### On the Future Technology Trend dashboard tab, I have used the data asset m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv and captured the following metrics as visualizations.
*	Top 10 LanguageDesireNextYear.
*	Top 10 DatabaseDesireNextYear.
*	PlatformDesireNextYear.
*	Top 10 WebFrameDesireNextYear.

### On the Demographics dashboard tab, I have used the data asset m5_survey_data_demographics.csv and captured the following metrics as visualizations.
*	Respondent classified by Gender
*	Respondent Count for Countries.
*	Respondent Count by Age.
*	Respondent Count by Gender, classified by Formal Education Level.
